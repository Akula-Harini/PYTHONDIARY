Features of Python

Easy to Learn & Read	
   Simple syntax close to human language.

Interpreted Language
   No need for compilation; runs directly from source.

Dynamically Typed	
   Variable types are determined at runtime.

Object-Oriented
    Everything is an object; supports classes, inheritance, etc.

Cross-Platform	
    Works on Windows, macOS, Linux, and mobile platforms.

Extensive Libraries	
    Comes with a large standard library + third-party ecosystem (PyPI).

Open Source	
    Freely available for modification and redistribution.

Scalable	
    Used for both small scripts and large enterprise systems.




Basic syntax Example

# Hello World program
print("Hello, World!")

# Variables and Data Types
name = "HARI"
age = 22
is_student = True

# Function
def greet(person):
    return f"Hello, {person}!"

print(greet(name))

| Concept                     | Description                                            |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Data Types**              | int, float, str, bool, list, tuple, set, dict          |
| **Control Flow**            | if, for, while, break, continue                        |
| **Functions**               | Defined using `def`, can return values                 |
| **Modules & Packages**      | Reusable code blocks; import with `import module_name` |
| **Classes & Objects**       | Supports encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism      |
| **File Handling**           | Open/read/write files using `open()`                   |
| **Error Handling**          | Try-except blocks to handle exceptions gracefully      |
| **Decorators & Generators** | Advanced tools for clean, reusable code                |
